# Generic challenges

This repository is a collection of several software projects that could have been proposed as challenges to solve during hiring processes. The purpose of this is to serve as an showcase of my implementations and their evolution over time, and also as a way for prospective companies to gauge some of my skills without resorting to examinations of this kind.

Also, provided these implementations are good (while surely not perfect, each one indeed fulfilled a certain purpose) they could help other developers, should they find themselves in a similar situation.
