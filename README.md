# Generic challenges

This repository is a collection of several software projects that could have been proposed as challenges to solve during hiring processes. The purpose of this is to serve as an showcase of my implementations and their evolution over time, and also as a way for prospective companies to gauge my skills without the need to involve themselves (and me) in exams like this.

Also, provided these implementations are any good (while surely not perfect, they indeed fulfilled their purpose :smirk:), they could help other developers that somehow find themselves in a similar situation.
